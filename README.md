# MIDIMasher
Combines two MIDI files into a chaotic mess.

## How to use
1. Get the Java Runtime Environment. You can find it on Oracle's Website.
2. Double-click on the JAR file. It's the same thing as the JAVA file, except it self-executes.
3. Follow the instructions on the terminal.
4. Listen to the madness.
