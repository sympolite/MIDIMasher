# MIDIMasher
Combines two MIDI files into a chaotic mess.

## How to use
1. Get the Java Runtime Environment. You can find it on Oracle's Website.
2. Make a folder called "MIDI" where you have the JAR saved, then load that folder up with MIDI files.
3. Double-click on the JAR file. It's the same thing as the JAVA file, except it self-executes.
4. Follow the instructions on the terminal.
5. Listen to the madness and enjoy.
